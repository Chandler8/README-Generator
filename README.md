The following is a command line application that allows users to dynamically generate a README.md file. If the user finds themselves unsure about what a properly formatted README should look and flow like, then this is the perfect app for them. Within this app you will find Node.js, NPM modules, Axios, Inquirer, and others. By eliminating the hassle of trying to properly format and remember all of the different categories involved with creating a README, this app will give users more time to focus on the quality of their products!
